# Pangolin
##### A game engine created and designed by me. Note that this is in early-early development 

## Specifications
##### Rendering API: Vulkan
##### Language: C++ 17
##### Platform: Windows only (for now)

## Getting started
Visual Studio 2019/2022 is recommended. Pangolin is not tested on other IDEs/Editors

<ins>**1. Downloading the repository:**</ins>

Start by cloning this repository using ```git clone https://www.github.com/ezyyn/Pangolin```. 
You do not have to update submodules, python scripts will handle that for you.

<ins>**2. Setting up the project:**</ins>

Navigate to```scripts```folder and run [Setup.bat](https://github.com/ezyyn/Pangolin/blob/master/scripts/Setup.bat). 
This script will ensure that you have the right dependencies and generate```Pangolin.sln```into the root folder.

## Goals
This engine is designed as a extensible core engine with editor. You can extend functionalities of this engine by creating your own extension! And also be fast as possible, one of the main goals of **Pangolin** is to be really lightweight and more solution specific. **(Not available not)**
